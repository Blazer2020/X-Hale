X-Hale is a portable digital spirometer developed by Team X-Hale. This low-cost spirometer can predict precise lung capacity measurements. We made an innovative design to increase the accuracy of the lung function measurements. This repository includes the X-Hale app the team developed in parallel with the spirometer to work with it. Design and PCB files of the spirometer are not included in the repository since they have pending patent approvals.
